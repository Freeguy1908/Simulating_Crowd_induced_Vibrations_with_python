# Project Description: Dynamic Response Simulation of SDoF Systems using Duhamel Integral

In this project, I developed a comprehensive approach to calculate the dynamic response of Single Degree of Freedom (SDoF) systems using the Duhamel Integral. Leveraging Python and Jupyter Notebooks, I implemented a robust solution to simulate the response of these systems to quasi-random human-induced excitations.

# Key Objectives:
  - Understanding Duhamel Integral: Gained in-depth knowledge of the Duhamel Integral and its application in determining the dynamic response of SDoF systems.
  - Python Implementation: Successfully implemented the mathematical solution in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
  - Simulating Quasi-Random Excitations: Utilized the numerical solution to simulate the dynamic response of SDoF systems subjected to quasi-random human-induced excitations, reflecting              realistic scenarios.
  - Data Visualization: Created insightful and interactive data visualizations to effectively communicate the results of the simulations, enhancing interpretability and decision-making.

# Skills Developed:
  - Proficiency in applying the Duhamel Integral for dynamic response calculations.
  - Advanced Python programming for numerical solutions in Jupyter Notebooks.
  - Expertise in simulating and analyzing complex excitation patterns.
  - Strong data visualization techniques to present simulation outputs clearly.

This project not only deepened my understanding of dynamic response analysis but also showcased my ability to translate theoretical concepts into practical, real-world applications using modern computational tools.
